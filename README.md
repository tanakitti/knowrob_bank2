In order to robustly perform tasks based on abstract instructions, robots need sophisticated knowledge processing
methods. These methods have to supply the difference between the (often shallow and symbolic) information in the
instructions and the (detailed, grounded and often real-valued) information needed for execution. For filling these
information gaps, a robot first has to identify them in the instructions, reason about suitable information sources,
and combine pieces of information from different sources and of different structure into a coherent knowledge base.
To this end the KnowRob knowledge processing system for robots provides ontologies and reasoning rules
tailored to filling in information gaps for successful task execution.

This repository contains
KnowRob core packages and general issue tracker for the KnowRob knowledge base.
